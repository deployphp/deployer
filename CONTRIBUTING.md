All code contributions must go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being merged.
This is to ensure proper review of all the code.

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send a pull request.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
the [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md).

## Make a Pull Request

The pull request description must include the following checklist at the top
to ensure that contributions may be reviewed without needless feedback
loops and that your contributions can be included into the core as quickly as
possible:

```
| Q             | A
| ------------- | ---
| Bug fix?      | yes|no
| New feature?  | yes|no
| BC breaks?    | yes|no
| Deprecations? | yes|no
| Fixed tickets | comma separated list of tickets fixed by the PR
```

The whole table must be included (do **not** remove lines that you think are
not relevant).
