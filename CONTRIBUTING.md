# Contributing to Deployer

Thank you for considering contributing to `Deployer`. Please make sure to read the following sections if you plan on submitting new issues or pull requests.

# Bug

In order for us to provide you with help as fast as possible, please make sure to include the following when reporting bugs.

* Deployer version
* PHP version
* Deployment target(s) OS

# New features

All code contributions must go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being merged.
This is to ensure proper review of all the code.

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send a pull request (one pull request per feature).

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
the [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md).

Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. 
If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) 
before submitting.

If you would like to help take a look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/issues).


## Make a Pull Request

The pull request description must include the following checklist at the top
to ensure that contributions may be reviewed without needless feedback
loops and that your contributions can be included into the core as quickly as
possible:

```
| Q             | A
| ------------- | ---
| Bug fix?      | yes|no
| New feature?  | yes|no
| BC breaks?    | yes|no
| Deprecations? | yes|no
| Fixed tickets | comma separated list of tickets fixed by the PR
```

The whole table must be included (do **not** remove lines that you think are
not relevant).
