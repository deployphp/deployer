# New features

All code contributions must go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being merged.
This is to ensure proper review of all the code.

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send a pull request (one pull request per feature).

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
the [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md).

Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. 
If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) 
before submitting.

If you would like to help take a look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/issues).
