# Bugsnag Recipe

```php
require 'contrib/bugsnag.php';
```

[Source](/contrib/bugsnag.php)



## Configuration
- *bugsnag_api_key* – the API Key associated with the project. Informs Bugsnag which project has been deployed. This is the only required field.
- *bugsnag_provider* – the name of your source control provider. Required when repository is supplied and only for on-premise services.
- *bugsnag_app_version* – the app version of the code you are currently deploying. Only set this if you tag your releases with semantic version numbers and deploy infrequently. (Optional.)
## Usage
Since you should only notify Bugsnag of a successful deployment, the `bugsnag:notify` task should be executed right at the end.
```php
after('deploy', 'bugsnag:notify');
```



## Tasks
