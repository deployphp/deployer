Installs npm packages.

In there is a {{previous_release}}, node_modules will be copied
from it before installing deps.
Uses `npm ci` command. This command is similar to npm install,
except it's meant to be used in automated environments such as
test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment -- or
any situation where you want to make sure you're doing a clean
install of your dependencies.
