### npm:install {#npm-install}
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/contrib/npm.php#L27)

Installs npm packages.

Uses `npm ci` command. This command is similar to npm install,
except it's meant to be used in automated environments such as
test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment -- or
any situation where you want to make sure you're doing a clean
install of your dependencies.
