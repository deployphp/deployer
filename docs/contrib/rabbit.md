# Rabbit Recipe

```php
require 'contrib/rabbit.php';
```

[Source](/contrib/rabbit.php)



### Installing

```php
deploy.php

require 'recipe/rabbit.php';
```

### Configuration options

- **rabbit** *(required)*: accepts an *array* with the connection information to [rabbitmq](http://www.rabbitmq.com) server token and team name.


You can provide also other configuration options:

 - *host* - default is localhost
 - *port* - default is 5672
 - *username* - default is *guest*
 - *password* - default is *guest*
 - *channel* - no default value, need to be specified via config
 - *message* - default is **Deployment to '{$host}' on *{$prod}* was successful\n($releasePath)**
 - *vhost* - default is


```php
deploy.php

set('rabbit', [
    'host'     => 'localhost',
    'port'     => '5672',
    'username' => 'guest',
    'password' => 'guest',
    'channel'  => 'notify-channel',
    'vhost'    => '/my-app'
]);
```

### Suggested Usage

Since you should only notify RabbitMQ channel of a successful deployment, the `deploy:rabbit` task should be executed right at the end.

```php
deploy.php

before('deploy:end', 'deploy:rabbit');
```



## Tasks

### deploy:rabbit
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/contrib/rabbit.php#L58)

Notifies RabbitMQ channel about deployment.
