# rsync

[Source](/contrib/rsync.php)



## IMPORTANT

This must not be confused with `/src/Utility/Rsync.php`, deployer's built-in rsync. Their configuration options are also very different, read carefully below.

## Installing

Add to your _deploy.php_

```php
require 'contrib/rsync.php';
```

## Configuration options

- **rsync**: Accepts an array with following rsync options (all are optional and defaults are ok):
    - *exclude*: accepts an *array* with patterns to be excluded from sending to server
    - *exclude-file*: accepts a *string* containing absolute path to file, which contains exclude patterns
    - *include*: accepts an *array* with patterns to be included in sending to server
    - *include-file*: accepts a *string* containing absolute path to file, which contains include patterns
    - *filter*: accepts an *array* of rsync filter rules
    - *filter-file*: accepts a *string* containing merge-file filename.
    - *filter-perdir*: accepts a *string* containing merge-file filename to be scanned and merger per each directory in rsync list on files to send
    - *flags*: accepts a *string* of flags to set when calling rsync command. Please **avoid** flags that accept params, and use *options* instead.
    - *options*: accepts an *array* of options to set when calling rsync command. **DO NOT** prefix options with `--` as it's automatically added.
    - *timeout*: accepts an *int* defining timeout for rsync command to run locally.

### Sample Configuration:

Following is default configuration. By default rsync ignores only git dir and `deploy.php` file.

```php
deploy.php

set('rsync',[
    'exclude'      => [
        '.git',
        'deploy.php',
    ],
    'exclude-file' => false,
    'include'      => [],
    'include-file' => false,
    'filter'       => [],
    'filter-file'  => false,
    'filter-perdir'=> false,
    'flags'        => 'rz', // Recursive, with compress
    'options'      => ['delete'],
    'timeout'      => 60,
]);
```

If You have multiple excludes, You can put them in file and reference that instead. If You use `deploy:rsync_warmup` You could set additional options that could speed-up and/or affect way things are working. For example:

```php
deploy.php

set('rsync',[
    'exclude'       => ['excludes_file'],
    'exclude-file'  => '/tmp/localdeploys/excludes_file', //Use absolute path to avoid possible rsync problems
    'include'       => [],
    'include-file'  => false,
    'filter'        => [],
    'filter-file'   => false,
    'filter-perdir' => false,
    'flags'         => 'rzcE', // Recursive, with compress, check based on checksum rather than time/size, preserve Executable flag
    'options'       => ['delete', 'delete-after', 'force'], //Delete after successful transfer, delete even if deleted dir is not empty
    'timeout'       => 3600, //for those huge repos or crappy connection
]);
```


### Parameter

- **rsync_src**: per-host rsync source. This can be server, stage or whatever-dependent. By default it's set to current directory
- **rsync_dest**: per-host rsync destination. This can be server, stage or whatever-dependent. by default it's equivalent to release deploy destination.

### Sample configurations:

This is default configuration:

```php
set('rsync_src', __DIR__);
set('rsync_dest','{{release_path}}');
```

If You use local deploy recipe You can set src to local release:

```php
host('hostname')
    ->hostname('10.10.10.10')
    ->port(22)
    ->set('deploy_path','/your/remote/path/app')
    ->set('rsync_src', '/your/local/path/app')
    ->set('rsync_dest','{{release_path}}');
```

## Usage

- `rsync` task

    Set `rsync_src` to locally cloned repository and rsync to `rsync_dest`. Then set this task instead of `deploy:update_code` in Your `deploy` task if Your hosting provider does not allow git.

- `rsync:warmup` task

    If Your deploy task looks like:

    ```php
    task('deploy', [
        'deploy:prepare',
        'deploy:release',
        'rsync',
        'deploy:vendors',
        'deploy:symlink',
    ])->desc('Deploy your project');
    ```

    And Your `rsync_dest` is set to `{{release_path}}` then You could add this task to run before `rsync` task or after `deploy:release`, whatever is more convenient.
