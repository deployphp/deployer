# How to Deploy Contao

[Source](/recipe/contao.php)

## How to deploy a Contao project with zero downtime?

- First, [install](/docs/installation.md) the Deployer. 
- Second, require `recipe/contao.php` recipe into your _deploy.php_ or _deploy.yaml_ file.
- Third, now you can have a zero downtime deployment!

Did you know that you can deploy **Contao** project with a single command? Just execute `dep deploy`.
Something went wrong? Just run `dep rollback` to rollback your changes.
Also, you can take an advantages of the [Deployer's CLI](/docs/cli.md) to deploy your project.

Another feature of the Deployer is [provisioning](/docs/recipe/provision.md). Take any server, and run `dep provision` command.
This command will configure webserver, databases, php, ssl certificates, and more. 
You will get everything you need to run your **Contao** application.

The contao recipe is based on the [symfony](/docs/recipe/symfony.md) recipe.

## Configuration
### public_path
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L11)

Overrides [public_path](/docs/recipe/provision/website.md#public_path) from `recipe/provision/website.php`.

The public path is the path to be set as DocumentRoot and is defined in the `composer.json` of the project
but defaults to `public` from Contao 5.0 on.
This path is relative from the [current_path](/docs/recipe/common.md#current_path), see [`recipe/provision/website.php`](/docs/recipe/provision/website.php#public_path).

});
