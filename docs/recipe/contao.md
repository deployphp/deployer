# How to Deploy a Contao Project

```php
require 'recipe/contao.php';
```

[Source](/recipe/contao.php)

Deployer is a free and open source deployment tool written in PHP. 
It helps you to deploy your Contao application to a server. 
It is very easy to use and has a lot of features. 

Three main features of Deployer are:
- **Provisioning** - provision your server for you.
- **Zero downtime deployment** - deploy your application without a downtime.
- **Rollbacks** - rollback your application to a previous version, if something goes wrong.

Additionally, Deployer has a lot of other features, like:
- **Easy to use** - Deployer is very easy to use. It has a simple and intuitive syntax.
- **Fast** - Deployer is very fast. It uses parallel connections to deploy your application.
- **Secure** - Deployer uses SSH to connect to your server.
- **Supports all major PHP frameworks** - Deployer supports all major PHP frameworks.

You can read more about Deployer in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md).

The contao recipe is based on the [symfony](/docs/recipe/symfony.md) recipe.

## Configuration
### public_path
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L11)

Overrides [public_path](/docs/recipe/provision/website.md#public_path) from `recipe/provision/website.php`.

The public path is the path to be set as DocumentRoot and is defined in the `composer.json` of the project
but defaults to `public` from Contao 5.0 on.
This path is relative from the [current_path](/docs/recipe/common.md#current_path), see [`recipe/provision/website.php`](/docs/recipe/provision/website.php#public_path).

```php title="Default value"
$composerConfig = json_decode(file_get_contents('./composer.json'), true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);

return $composerConfig['extra']['public-dir'] ?? 'public';
```


### bin/console
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L29)

Overrides [bin/console](/docs/recipe/symfony.md#bin/console) from `recipe/symfony.php`.



```php title="Default value"
return '{{bin/php}} {{release_or_current_path}}/vendor/bin/contao-console';
```


### contao_version
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L33)



```php title="Default value"
$result = run('{{bin/console}} --version');
preg_match_all('/(\d+\.?)+/', $result, $matches);
return $matches[0][0] ?? 'n/a';
```


### symfony_version
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L39)

Overrides [symfony_version](/docs/recipe/symfony.md#symfony_version) from `recipe/symfony.php`.



```php title="Default value"
$result = run('{{bin/console}} about');
preg_match_all('/(\d+\.?)+/', $result, $matches);
return $matches[0][0] ?? 5.0;
```



## Tasks

### contao:migrate
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/contao.php#L55)

Run Contao migrations.

This task updates the database. A database backup is saved automatically as a default.

To automatically drop the obsolete database structures, you can override the task as follows:

```php
task('contao:migrate', function () {
    run('{{bin/php}} {{bin/console}} contao:migrate --with-deletes {{console_options}}');
});
```


### contao:manager:download
