Deployer is a free and open source deployment tool written in PHP. 
It helps you to deploy your Craftcms application to a server. 
It is very easy to use and has a lot of features. 

Three main features of Deployer are:

- **Rollbacks** - rollback your application to a previous version, if something goes wrong.

Additionally, Deployer has a lot of other features, like:
- **Easy to use** - Deployer is very easy to use. It has a simple and intuitive syntax.
- **Fast** - Deployer is very fast. It uses parallel connections to deploy your application.
