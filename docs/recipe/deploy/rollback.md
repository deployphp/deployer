## Tasks

### rollback
[Source](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer/blob/master/recipe/deploy/rollback.php#L62)

Rollbacks to the previous release.

Uses [rollback_candidate](/docs/recipe/deploy/rollback.md#rollback_candidate) for symlinking. Current release will be marked as
bad by creating file **BAD_RELEASE** with timestamp and [user](/docs/recipe/common.md#user).

:::warning
You can always manually symlink [current_path](/docs/recipe/common.md#current_path) to proper release.
```
dep run '{{bin/symlink}} releases/123 {{current_path}}'
```
