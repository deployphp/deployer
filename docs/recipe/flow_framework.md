# How to Deploy Flow Framework

[Source](/recipe/flow_framework.php)

## How to deploy a Flow Framework project with zero downtime?

- First, [install](/docs/installation.md) the Deployer. 
- Second, require `recipe/flow_framework.php` recipe into your _deploy.php_ or _deploy.yaml_ file.
- Third, now you can have a zero downtime deployment!

Did you know that you can deploy **Flow Framework** project with a single command? Just execute `dep deploy`.
Something went wrong? Just run `dep rollback` to rollback your changes.
Also, you can take an advantage of the [Deployer's CLI](/docs/cli.md) to deploy your project.

Another cool feature of the Deployer is [provisioning](/docs/recipe/provision.md). Take any server, and run `dep provision` command.
This command will configure webserver, databases, php, ssl certificates, and more. 
You will get everything you need to run your **Flow Framework** application.

The flow_framework recipe is based on the [common](/docs/recipe/common.md) recipe.
