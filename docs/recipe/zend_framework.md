Deployer is a free and open source deployment tool written in PHP. 
It helps you to deploy your Zend Framework application to a server.

- **Rollbacks** - rollback your application to a previous version, if something goes wrong.

Additionally, Deployer has a lot of other features, like:
- **Easy to use** - Deployer is very easy to use. It has a simple and intuitive syntax.
